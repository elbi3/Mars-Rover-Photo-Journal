# Mars Rover Photo Journal

About this project
This is a revived personal project originally built in 2023 using SSR with Express.js and EJS template engine library.
The original repository is no longer maintained.
This version updates dependencies and restores functionality while preserving the original design and server-side rendering approach. It uses old, mock data to compensate for the NASA API no longer being maintained.

## Purpose
This app displays photos from one of the publicly available NASA APIs. My goal for it from the start has been to work with data I enjoy, and to focus primarily on the Express.js web application framework. Most courses and walkthroughs that I have encountered for Node.js fullstack software projects (such as PERN, MERN, and MEAN) rush through the Express portion, and I felt I was missing out on a more in-depth understanding of this middleware. I also wanted more experience with the http request and response cycle, and a more thorough understanding of Express's file structure in `routes/views` for creating routes on a site or for creating API paths.

Robert Bunch's [course](https://gale.udemy.com/course/just-express-with-a-bunch-of-node-and-http-in-detail/learn/lecture/11301584#overview) "Just Express (with a bunch of node and http). In detail." was instrumental in helping me create this.
